# GitStake Quest System API Documentation

## Overview

The GitStake Quest System is an AI-powered coding challenge platform that creates weekly quests for developers based on their skill levels. The system leverages Pollinations.ai to generate engaging coding challenges and manages the complete quest lifecycle from creation to results.

## Quest Lifecycle

### Weekly Schedule
- **Sunday**: New quests are generated and staking begins
- **Monday-Tuesday**: Staking period (developers can stake to participate)
- **Wednesday-Thursday**: Challenge period (staked developers can submit solutions)
- **Friday**: Quest closes, results are processed
- **Saturday**: Winners are announced and rewards distributed

## Developer Levels

The system supports 8 developer levels, each with unique characteristics:

1. **ROOKIE** üå± - Just starting the coding journey (0-20 points)
2. **EXPLORER** üîç - Exploring technologies and building foundations (21-35 points)
3. **BUILDER** üî® - Building solid projects and gaining momentum (36-50 points)
4. **CRAFTSMAN** ‚ö° - Crafting quality code with growing expertise (51-65 points)
5. **ARCHITECT** üèóÔ∏è - Designing complex systems and leading projects (66-80 points)
6. **WIZARD** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Mastering multiple domains with exceptional skills (81-90 points)
7. **LEGEND** üëë - Legendary contributor with massive impact (91-95 points)
8. **TITAN** üöÄ - Titan of code - reshaping the development world (96-100 points)

## Email Notifications

The system automatically sends three types of emails:

1. **Staking Notification** - When a user stakes for a quest
2. **Challenge Start** - When the challenge period begins (Wednesday)
3. **Results Announcement** - When winners are announced (Saturday)

## Environment Variables

```env
POLLINATIONS_API_URL=https://text.pollinations.ai/
EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
AUTO_START_CRON=true
```

## Cron Schedule

- **Sunday 00:00 UTC**: Generate weekly quests
- **Every hour**: Update quest statuses
- **Daily 09:00 UTC**: Send scheduled notifications
- **Friday 01:00 UTC**: Process closed quest results

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standardized error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "error": "Detailed error information (in development)"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

- AI quest generation includes 2-second delays between requests
- Email sending is throttled to prevent spam
- Cron jobs include error handling and retry logic

## Testing

Use the provided Postman collection `GitStake-API.postman_collection.json` for testing all endpoints.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env`

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
# or for development
npm run dev
```

4. The cron jobs will auto-start in production or when `AUTO_START_CRON=true`

## Manual Testing

You can manually trigger quest generation and processing:

```bash
# Generate weekly quests
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/trigger/weeklyQuestGeneration

# Update quest statuses
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/trigger/statusUpdate

# Send notifications
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/trigger/notifications

# Process results
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/trigger/resultsProcessing
```
